          <p><strong>Guys, Arkansas sucks.</strong> But before I go and start offending <em>everybody</em>, let&rsquo;s address the proverbial elephant in the room. This &ldquo;blog&rdquo; is called Dan Has Plan. I live in a car that is conveniently named an &ldquo;Element&rdquo; and so while it would be <em>facile</em> to adopt an obvious title riffing off of various puns about elements and how I may or may not be in one, I would not stoop so low. Moreso, and let this be the bottom line:</p>

<p><strong>I have plan.</strong></p>

<p>Back to Arkansas, but let&rsquo;s start with Memphis. Memphis is the current domain of THE Griffin Smith. Patient Zero, one might say. In visiting a Griffin Smith, one can only spend so much time in a Griffin Smith&rsquo;s house before ze begins to <em>be</em> a Griffin Smith in mind, body, and spirit (not a <em>bad</em> thing, just a <em>different</em> thing), and this is important for the visitor to know because, much like death by carbon monoxide poisoning, becoming a Griffin Smith is a subtle but effective process. Signs of the transformation include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking for just one bite or sip</li>
<li>Watching TVs that are on the ceiling with no issue whatsoever</li>
<li>Sprawling</li>
<li>Waking up early and asking that all other Griffin Smiths do the same</li>
<li>Fastidiously organizing half of one&rsquo;s things</li>
<li>Being an exemplary friend &lt;3</li>
<li>Wearing criminally loose socks</li>
</ul>

<p>And humans are not the only vectors for this transformation&ndash;non-humans are susceptible as well. It was clear that in this particular Griffin Smith&rsquo;s house there were at least five others living there as well (I believe that two lived in the crawlspace beneath the house).</p>

<p>Now, when one begins to <em>be</em> a Griffin Smith, ze begins to think like one, and therefore becomes receptive to ideas like making the first destination of a life-changing and deeply significant Road Trip <strong>Hot Springs, Arkansas</strong>. Decisions like these are not necessarily wrong, but they are certainly not correct. And it is here that I would like to confess to an infliction of my own.</p>

<p><strong>I have no plan and in this I have lost all control.</strong></p>

<p>You may find that the words of this &ldquo;blog&rdquo; are contradictory, but you must not accept it. In the particularly relevant words of George Orwell, it will be necessary &ldquo;to forget whatever it [is] necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment it [is] needed, and then promptly to forget it again.&rdquo; In this &ldquo;blog&rdquo; we will &ldquo;use logic against logic&rdquo;, and we will not even know it, as it will be purely emotional. Case in point: to arrive in Hot Springs is to leave Hot Springs. Like after two hours because damn that place has some <em>vibes</em>. Get out and stay vibes. Become us and live to die vibes. Nuh-uh. Let&rsquo;s go to Houston.</p>
